As the title includes the word `Recalibration`. So let's start by writing about it in this journey.

> **Recalibration:** to correct or adjust the gradations or settings on a measuring instrument. (from dictionary.com)

Sometimes I hit a places while navigating in this overwhelming world, where my internal compass starts behaving strangely.
And I start experiencing certain things like:

* Directionless thoughts
* SelfDoubt
* BurnOut, etc.

---

In order to overcome these things, I enter re-calibration time and try to adjust myself by;

* I don't know how :); I think by staying that way for sometime
* Letting thoughts to flow
* By reflecting on my journey

> Note: I am writing this log, during my re-calibration time :)


WITH THIS LET'S START THE JOURNEY :)

p.s. there are going to be lot of recalibration !!!
